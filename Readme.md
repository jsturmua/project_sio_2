This project, as part of the Information Security in Organizations course project, tasked us with creating a web application for the DETI product store. The application was required to have an initial version with vulnerabilities and a second version with these vulnerabilities resolved.

To achieve this, we developed a simple application with a discreet design. While some functionalities are not 100% operational, they will not interfere with the main objective of the project, which is to demonstrate and correct these vulnerabilities.

The vulnerabilities are as follows:
- 2 SQL Injections
- 2 Cross Site Scripting
- 1 Plain text (CWE-256)
- 1 Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
