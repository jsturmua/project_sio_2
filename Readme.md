This project, as part of the Information Security in Organizations course project, tasked us with creating a web application for the DETI product store. The application was required to have an initial version and a second version with 6 improved issues. Furthermore we do the implementation of two software features in order to improve the application.

To achieve this, we developed a simple application with a discreet design. While some functionalities are not 100% operational, they will not interfere with the main objective of the project, which is to demonstrate and correct the issues.

The issues are as follows:
- Password Security Credentials - Jonathan Sturm
- Session Management (Fundamental Session Management Requirements, Session Binding Requirements, Session Logout and Timeout Requirements) - Jonathan Sturm
- General Data Protection - Georgi Vasilev
- Client-side Data Protection- Georgi Vasilev
- Sensitive Data Protection- Georgi Vasilev
  
The two improved software features are these:
- Password strength evaluation: requiring a minimum of strength for passwords according to V2.1, with
breach verification using an external service; - Jonathan Sturm
- Automatically Deleting Old Session Data where I implemented a feature to automatically remove outdated session data- Georgi Vasilev
- User Data Deletion Method where I created a method to allow users to delete their data using a "Delete Data" button. The button triggers the delete_data method, which you can implement to handle the deletion of user-specific data- Georgi Vasilev
- Privacy Policy Tab where added a new tab to the HTML file to display the privacy policy. You can link to an external privacy policy page or include the policy directly within the tab- Georgi Vasilev
