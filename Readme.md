This project, as part of the Information Security in Organizations course project, tasked us with creating a web application for the DETI product store. The application was required to have an initial version and a second version with 6 improved issues. Furthermore we do the implementation of two software features in order to improve the application.

To achieve this, we developed a simple application with a discreet design. While some functionalities are not 100% operational, they will not interfere with the main objective of the project, which is to demonstrate and correct the issues.

The issues are as follows:
- Password Security Credentials - Jonathan Sturm
- Session Management (Fundamental Session Management Requirements, Session Binding Requirements, Session Logout and Timeout Requirements) - Jonathan Sturm
- General Data Protection - Georgi Vasilev
- Client-side Data Protection- Georgi Vasilev
- Sensitive Data Protection- Georgi Vasilev
  
The two improved software features are these:
- Password strength evaluation: requiring a minimum of strength for passwords according to V2.1, with
breach verification using an external service; - Jonathan Sturm
- Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) requiring the user to provide two or more verification factors to
gain access to the Web application: TOTP authentication login: enable login via one-time passwords generated with TOTP to authorize
access to the Web application (relevant ASVS requirements: ASVS V2.8);
